# tugis-sensors
This is all the code used by the tugis-sensor demo by Matt Wisniewski and Chris Hogan.

There are three directories:
*client* contains the sample front end code. This is a static site and can be deployed using any static web host.
*server* contains the data that the sensors push up, as well as api endpoints for the client to request the data. This is an active node application and requires dynamic hosting. We use digital ocean in the demo.
*sensors* contains everything to get the sensors up and running. Specifics/walk throughs for setup are found here.
